# Software Design Formulary

This repository contains a LaTeX summary for the "Software Design" formulary. The content of this formulary is based on the course materials from the Software Design lecture at ETH Zurich. The formulary covers various topics in software design, including Java programming, design patterns, and behavioral, structural, and creational patterns.

If you find this formulary helpful, I would appreciate it if you could consider giving it a star ‚≠ê on GitHub. Your support encourages me to continue creating educational content.

## Course Overview

- **Abstract:** This formulary is based on the undergraduate course "Software Design" at ETH Zurich. The course presents and discusses design patterns regularly used to solve problems in object-oriented design and object-oriented programming. The presented patterns are illustrated with examples from the Java libraries and are applied in a project.

- **Objective:** The students completing this course are expected to:
  - Know the principles of object-oriented programming and can apply these.
  - Know the most important object-oriented design patterns.
  - Apply design patterns to solve design problems.
  - Discover in a given design the use of design patterns.

- **Content:** This course introduces object-oriented programming using Java. However, the main focus is on object-oriented design, particularly design patterns. Design patterns are solutions to recurring design problems. The discussed patterns are illustrated with examples from the Java libraries and are applied in the context of a project.

- **Lecture notes:** No script provided.

  - Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides; Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software; Prentice Hall; ISBN 978-0201633610
  - Freeman, Freeman, Sierra; Head First Design Patterns, Head First Design Patterns; O'Reilly; ISBN 978-0596007126

- **Prerequisites / Notice:** The course "Software Design" is designed for students in the computational sciences program but is open to students of all programs. The precondition is that participants have knowledge in structured programming (e.g., with C, C++, C# or Java).
